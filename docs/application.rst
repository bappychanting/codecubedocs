Built-in Application
====================

To help you give a clear understanding of the standard way of managing the Models, Controllers, Guards, Views, migrations, markups, assets etc. within the framework, CodeCube provides a demo mini-application. Go to *your-server-url/migration_url-defined-in-url-config* in your browser, provide application key from ``APP_KEY`` constant in **env.php** and run migration. Afterwards go to welcome page and click on Demo App link to check out the application. You will find all their model, controller and view files in appropriate folders in the application. Check those codes out and afterwards, you can start developing your new application from there.
