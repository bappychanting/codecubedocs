**An easy & lightweight PHP framework inspired by **\ `Laravel <https://laravel.com>`_.

Aims of this framework are to-

* Provide a foundation to creative PHP developers for faster dynamic website development. Small, hand-built libraries that the framework is based on guarantee minimum performance overhead.

* Assist PHP newcomers who are looking forward to begin coding in Laravel. Due to familiar, pure PHP coding in a similar structure to Laravel framework, it will be easier for a PHP beginner to adopt this framework, evaluate how the basics of a web framework work and switch to Laravel later on.
