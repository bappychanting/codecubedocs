Server Requirements
=====

The CodeCube framework has a few system requirements. Installing Apache distribution packages such as Xampp, Wamp, Laragon (for windows) or a standard Lamp stack setup (for Linux) will satisfy most if not all requirements. If you are setting up an Apache server manually, make sure your server meets the following requirements:

* PHP >= 7.2.0
* BCMath PHP Extension
* Ctype PHP Extension
* JSON PHP Extension
* Mbstring PHP Extension
* OpenSSL PHP Extension
* PDO PHP Extension
* Tokenizer PHP Extension
* XML PHP Extension

Additional Requirements
-----------

* Relational database such as MySQL
* Git
* Composer
* A standard HTML supported browser 

You can follow this tutorial while setting up Lamp server in Debian based Linux distro to ensure your server setup is up to the standard.
